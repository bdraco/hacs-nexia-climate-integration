The `nexia` component lets you control thermostats connected to [Nexia (Trane/American Standard)](https://www.nexiahome.com/).

By connecting this component, you will have access to all thermostats and zones in your associated home.

See the [Github readme](https://github.com/ryannazaretian/hacs-nexia-climate-integration) for installation and configuration.
